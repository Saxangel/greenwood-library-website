# greenwood-library-website
A website for Greenwood Library
I created a repository on GitHub and cloned it to my local machine. After making the necessary changes, I staged, committed, and pushed updates to the respective branches designated for the two developers, Morgan and Jamie. Subsequently, I initiated a pull request to merge the changes into the main branch.
