# CapStone Project: Enhancing a Community Library Website
## Greenwood library website
A website for Greenwood Library
I created a repository on GitHub and cloned it to my local machine. After making the necessary changes, I staged, committed, and pushed updates to the respective branches designated for the two developers, Morgan and Jamie. Subsequently, I initiated a pull request to merge the changes into the main branch.




## Steps
- 1. I created a repository on GITHUB, cloned it to VSCode and changed to the directory using the command "git clone https://github.com/Saxangel/greenwood-library-website.git"

- 2. In the main branch, using Visual Studio Code editor, I created files for each of the below web pages with content in each file.
   - home.html
   - about_us.html
   - events.html
   - contact_us.html


   ### Creation of the files


- 3. Then i staged, committed and pushed the changes directly to the main branch.

- Pushed to the main using the command "git push origin main"
